The BBC news classification is an exercise that uses matrix factorization and NLP techniques to categorize BBC articles. Note that I had incorrectly assume an answer key applied to this data when in reality it had to be submitted through Kaggle for grading, but the code and design is generally sound. The discussion about training, matrix factorization, and NLP is all valid. My complaints about train-test divergence comes from this erroneous assumption, but I do not have the correct answer key to fix this, so I have left as is.
